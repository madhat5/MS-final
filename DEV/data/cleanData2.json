In World War I, he fought in the 92nd Infantry with General Pershing in major European campaigns. On July 3, 1906 while Broadus was a first sergeant stationed at Fort Niobrara, NE, a disgruntled private attempted to shoot an officer who had reported him for abusive language. Broadus grabbed the rifle by the muzzle as the shot was fired, thereby protecting the officer and nearly being hit by the bullet himself. For this action, he was awarded a Certificate of Merit from President Theodore Roosevelt. The award was later converted to a Distinguished Service Cross on April 26, 1934. After lobbying efforts by the family, the Department of the Army issued the Cross to Lewis Broadus's surviving family members in 2006.",
